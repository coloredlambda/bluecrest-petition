## Set up project
Clone the project unto your computer and navigate to project directory
To set up project you need node version 6 installed and an internet connection.
Yarn is the preferred package manager for the project. To install Yarn run
> npm i -g yarn

Once yarn is installed, run this command in the project root to install all the project packages for the server
> yarn install

Once it is complete, navigate into the client folder and run the same command in there
> yarn install

Now navigate back to the root of the project and run
> node server.js

Open a seperate terminal window, navigate into the client folder and run 
> yarn start

Wait patiently for server to start then you point your browser to *http://localhost:3000*
